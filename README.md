Master Thesis on comparing various state-of-the-art Dynamic Nelcon Siegel methods.
I investigate models to fit the term-structure derived from Euro-market data and compare them along in-sample-fit, out-of-sample-fit (i.e. forecasting accuracy) as well as robustness.
Models considered include:
- Dynamic Nelson Siegel
- Dynamic Nelson Siegel with time-varying shape(=loading) parameter
- Dynamic Nelson Siegel with time-varying common volatility parameter
- Dynamic Nelson Siegel with time-varying shape- and volatility parameter
- Arbitrage Free Dynamic Nelson Siegel
- (and, if time allows: Dynamic Nelson Siegel with Markov-Switching Regime Changes)
